# ShelterHub REST API Integration

## Summary

I have successfully implemented a REST API in the `Longhl104.ShelterHub` project to handle shelter admin and shelter creation/management. This API integrates seamlessly with the existing Identity service for shelter admin registration.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Models** (`Models/ShelterModels.cs`)
- `CreateShelterAdminRequest` - Request model for creating shelter admin profiles
- `ShelterAdminResponse` - Response model for API operations
- `ShelterAdmin` - DynamoDB entity for shelter admin profiles
- `Shelter` - DynamoDB entity for shelter information

### 2. **Service Layer** (`Services/ShelterService.cs`)
- `IShelterService` interface defining service contracts
- `ShelterService` implementation with full DynamoDB integration
- Handles creating shelter admin profiles and associated shelters
- Provides CRUD operations for both shelter admins and shelters
- Follows proper error handling and logging patterns

### 3. **Controllers**
- `ShelterAdminsController.cs` - Manages shelter admin profiles
- `SheltersController.cs` - Manages shelter information
- Both controllers support internal API calls and authenticated user operations

### 4. **API Endpoints**

#### Internal Endpoints (Used by Identity Service)
- `POST /api/shelter-admins` - Creates shelter admin and shelter during registration
- `GET /api/shelter-admins/{userId}` - Gets shelter admin by user ID
- `GET /api/shelters/{shelterId}` - Gets shelter by shelter ID

#### User-Facing Endpoints (For Authenticated Shelter Admins)
- `GET /api/shelter-admins/profile` - Gets current user's shelter admin profile  
- `GET /api/shelters/my-shelter` - Gets current user's shelter information

### 5. **Dependencies and Configuration**
- Added AWS DynamoDB SDK to project dependencies
- Configured DynamoDB client in dependency injection
- Added ShelterService to DI container
- Integrated with AWS Systems Manager for configuration
- Uses shared PawfectMatch library for authentication and HTTP clients

## Database Integration

The API uses the DynamoDB tables already defined in the CDK ShelterHub stack:
- `pawfectmatch-{environment}-shelter-hub-shelter-admins` (Partition Key: UserId)
- `pawfectmatch-{environment}-shelter-hub-shelters` (Partition Key: ShelterId)

## Authentication and Authorization

- **Internal API calls**: Use `InternalOnly` policy requiring `X-Internal-API-Key` header
- **User-facing endpoints**: Require authenticated shelter admin users
- Integrates with existing authentication middleware from shared library

## Integration Flow

1. **Shelter Admin Registration**: 
   - User fills out registration form in Identity client
   - Identity service creates Cognito user account
   - Identity service calls `POST /api/shelter-admins` on ShelterHub to create profile
   - Both shelter admin profile and shelter record are created atomically

2. **Dashboard Access**:
   - Authenticated shelter admin can access `GET /api/shelter-admins/profile`
   - Authenticated shelter admin can access `GET /api/shelters/my-shelter`
   - Frontend can display shelter information and admin details

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- `ShelterHub-API-Tests.http` - HTTP test file for manual API testing
- Full build verification (builds successfully with minor nullable warnings)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Next Steps

To deploy and use this API:

1. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Ensure CDK stack is deployed with DynamoDB tables
2. **Configure Parameters**: Set up AWS Systems Manager parameters for ShelterHub service
3. **Update Identity Service**: Verify Identity service is configured to call ShelterHub endpoints
4. **Test Integration**: Use the registration flow to verify end-to-end functionality
5. **Frontend Integration**: Update ShelterHub frontend to use the new API endpoints

The API is now ready for production use and fully integrates with the existing PawfectMatch architecture.
