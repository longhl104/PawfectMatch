   ./scripts/publish-pawfect-match-ng.sh
   ```
3. Follow the interactive prompts
4. Review the dry run output
5. Confirm publication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Error**
   ```
   npm ERR! 401 Unauthorized
   ```
   Solution: Run `npm login` and authenticate

2. **Permission Denied**
   ```
   npm ERR! 403 Forbidden
   ```
   Solution: Ensure you have publish permissions for the `@longhl104` scope

3. **Version Already Exists**
   ```
   npm ERR! 403 You cannot publish over the previously published versions
   ```
   Solution: Bump the version number

4. **Build Errors**
   - Check TypeScript compilation errors
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Verify Angular version compatibility

### Debug Mode

For debugging, you can run commands manually:

```bash
# Check npm configuration
npm config list

# Check package details
npm view @longhl104/pawfect-match-ng

# Test build locally
ng build pawfect-match-ng --configuration production

# Dry run publish
cd dist/longhl104/pawfect-match-ng
npm publish --dry-run
```

## Post-Publication

After successful publication:

1. **Verify the package**: Visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/@longhl104/pawfect-match-ng
2. **Test installation**: Try installing in a test project
3. **Update documentation**: Update any consuming applications
4. **Tag the release**: Consider creating a git tag for the version

## Security Notes

- Never commit npm authentication tokens
- Use `--access public` for public packages
- Review package contents before publishing
- Consider using npm's two-factor authentication
